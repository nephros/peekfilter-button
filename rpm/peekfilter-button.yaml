Description: |
     Adds a Settings entry to configure and a TopMenu switch to disable edge swipes.

     Say you are playing a game or are editing an image in some app, but the edge swipe gets in the way and wants to minimize the app.
     Simple, swipe down the Top Menu, tap the button, swipe up again. Problem goes away.

     But DO remember to disable the button again soon, else you will have a bad time interacting with SFOS ;)

     After installing, you will have to restart Lipstick, so you can enable the button.
