## Edge Swipe Control for Lipstick

Adds a Settings entry to configure and a Top Menu switch to disable edge
swipes.

This app serves two functions:

One, it allows to set the `peekBundaryWidth` from the Settings app.  
See [Easing Edge Swipe](https://docs.sailfishos.org/Reference/Sailfish_OS_Tips_and_Tricks/#easing-edge-swipe) about that.

Two, say you are playing a game or are editing an image in some app, but the
edge swipe gets in the way and wants to minimize the app.  
Simple, swipe down the Top Menu, tap the switch, swipe up again. Problem goes away.

But DO remember to disable the switch again soon, else you will have a bad time
interacting with SFOS ;)

For safety reasons, the button automatically disables itself when the device locks.
